# User requirements for text management system

The below should inform ongoing refinement/expansion of the text management system.

```
As a creator/maintainer of text excerpts
I want:
- to manage all excerpts in one place
- to group related excerpts in appropriate categories
- to include relevant metadata for each excerpt
```

```
As a developer working on code which displays or hides text in the game
I want:
- a simple, repeatable process for displaying excerpts
- clear and readily accessible information about available excerpts
- to be alerted by the IDE/compiler if code does not use excerpts correctly (avoid runtime failure)
```

```
As a developer working on the game's visual interface
I want:
- displayed text to look good in the context of the game
- flexibility in the placement and layout of text elements
- to ensure text is legible:
  - not overlapping other visible elements
  - appropriate brightness and colour contrast based on text placement
  - a suitable size on the user's screen
- to ensure the text's meaning/function is not adversely affected
 by
 formatting ;)
```

```
As a developer working on custom configuration options
I want:
- control over text properties such as colour, font and size
- a simple method to instantly apply global changes
```

```
As a player
I want to only see text that improves my experience!
```
